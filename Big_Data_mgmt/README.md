# SQL

## What is SQL 
__SQL__ (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage), pronounced "_S_"-"_Q_"-"_L_", historically "_SEQUEL_") is a language used to manage data, in a Relational DB Management System (RDBMS). It is useful to handle structured data.

Introduced in the 1970s, originally based upon relational algebra, SQL includes data query, data manipulation (i.e. insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

## History 
SQL was initially developed at IBM by D. Chamberlin and R. Boyce after implementing about the relational model in the early 1970s. The initial version, called "_SEQUEL_" (**S**tructured **E**nglish **QUE**ry **L**anguage), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original almost relational database management system developed during the 1970s.

First attempt at a relational database language was SQUARE (**S**pecifying **QU**eries in **A** **R**elational **E**nvironment), but it was difficult to use due to notation. 

The original name SEQUEL was later changed to SQL (dropping the vowels) because "SEQUEL" was a trademark. The name SQL later became the acronym for Structured Query Languag

After testing SQL to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on homonymous prototype, which were commercially available between end of 1970s and start of 1980s.

By 1986, ANSI and ISO officially adopted the language SQL as  standard. New versions of it were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2016 respectively and most recently, 2023.
